# Learning-New-Skills
This is a repository show casing new skills I've been learning in my own down time.

Heya, welcome to my little corner where I plan to actively track and record new skills such as learning how and why some frameworks are used such as Spring as well as how to use API's in order to develop an inventory manager for books! 

This may seem like an incohesive mess and that's because it is but I just wanted a way to display and record my current practice online so I can track my progress over time. The reason being that although I learnt aspects of programming from my time in University it's clear to see that much of it was surface level however, still integral to learn. I aim to learn and develop myself further so this is where I'll be doing it.
